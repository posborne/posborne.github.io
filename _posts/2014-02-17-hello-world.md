Welcome to my tech blog.  At this point there isn't much here, but in
the future I hope to being documenting some of my thoughts on various
tech related things.  In particular, I would like to use this space to
look at some different things that come up while architecting,
designing, and building systems in software.

I would also like to look at the intersection between ivory tower
computer science and software engineering that happens on the ground,
particularly focused at Embedded systems and the burgeoning Internet
of Things pheonomenom as that is the space I have worked in my entire
professional career.
